Description of the analysis:

On the uploaded Excel file - Module 1 is the given code and Module 2 is the refactored code. The code is refactored based on few key principles that include clean code, logical blocks and certain parts of the code were re-written and tested separately before made into the full code.  

First:  Taken advantage of the existing data set that the ticker is in alphaebitcal order.  No more need of hardcoding the ticker symbol rather let the code do that for us.  

Second:  Use arrays for the outputs.  This will allow scalability of the dataset and allows the user to perform further analysis using the collected data as needed. 

Third:  Logical blocks.  This will allow the code review, additional new functionality as needed relatively easier.
